            "The image presents a geometric figure consisting of a square inscribed within a circle. The square is positioned with its vertices aligned with the center of the circle, and its sides are parallel to the diameter of the circle. Key Properties:  Symmetry: The square exhibits rotational symmetry of order 4, meaning it looks the same after a rotation of 90 degrees around its center.  Angles: The square has right angles (90-degree angles) at each of its corners.  Parallelism: The sides of the square are parallel to the diameter of the circle, indicating that the square is inscribed in the circle.  Radius: The radius of the circle is equal to the length of the side of the square, as the square is inscribed in the circle.  Diameter: The diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Calculations:  Side Length of the Square: Let's assume the side length of the square is \"s\". Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is also \"s√2\" (using the Pythagorean theorem).  Radius of the Circle: The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so it is \"s/√2\".  Diameter of the Circle: The diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square, which is \"s√2\". JSON Output: Here is the JSON output in key-value pairs: ```json { \"figure_type\": \"square_inscribed_in_circle\", \"symmetry\": \"rotational_symmetry_of_order_4\", \"angles\": \"right_angles\", \"parallelism\": \"parallel_to_diameter\", \"radius\": \"s/√2\", \"diameter\": \"s√2\" } ``` This JSON output provides a structured representation of the geometric figure, highlighting its key properties and relationships.\n"
